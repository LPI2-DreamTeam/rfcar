% CHAPTER - Testing ---------------
\chapter{Testing}%
\label{ch:testing}
After implementing the solution developed in the various domains into the
target platforms, the system's behaviour is tested in several levels of
granularity: at the subsystem level --- unit testing, and system level ---
integrated testing. The idea is progressively test the behaviour of each
subsystem and its integration into the system.
In this chapter are presented the unit testing and integrated testing for the \gls{rfcar}.
