\subsubsection{Bluetooth}%
\label{sec:bluetooth-test}
After effectively changing the direction of a ball according to the accelerometer's state in the section \ref{sec:accelerometer-using-data-test}, one could only need to merge its code with the Bluetooth connection setup, so that, instead of sending plain text messages, one can transfer the acceleration values.

The first test was based on testing the Bluetooth connection setup when the interface was comprised of two distinct smartphones. With that in mind, the connection was successful and the devices were able to exchange messages, as expected. Since this test was performed using the code done in another course unit no further in-depth explanations will be presented in this section as the code was fully functional.
