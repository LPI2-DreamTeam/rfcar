\subsubsection{UI}%
\label{sec:user-interface}
In the beginning, an app \gls{ui} was initially thought out and made a first test design.
When the user opens the program, the image of the RFCAR appears along with a built-in set of features. It is then explained the vehicle purpose as a navigation tool through inhospitable environments.

Following that, on the top left corner, there's a button that when pressed it redirects to the main app activity (more on that later) allowing first-person vision on the controlled car just like a simulated car game, only this time in a real-life scenario. Some statistics, such as the transport position and its velocity, appear in front of full-screen video capture.

From that point on, one can also choose to see the map and possibly the route traced along with some more detailed statistics of the remote control car.
