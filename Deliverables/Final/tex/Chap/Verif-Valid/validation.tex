For that reason, the app was tested by a user outside of the workgroup. Instructions were given to him so that he could understand the concept to navigate through the user-friendly app and report any bugs or challenges faced when performing the following steps:

Step 1) Introduce the user to the last version of the android application: RFCAR app, after instructions given by one of the developers.

Step 6) Press the Scan Devices button and wait until the Bluetooth enabled target device appears on Discovered Devices subsection and press it. If the target device to pair with doesn't appear, turn on its Bluetooth. A message to conclude the pair phase should appear on both device with a corresponding PIN. Certificate that the PINs match and then click allow and yes on both devices to conclude this stage.
