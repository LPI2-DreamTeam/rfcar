\subsection{Correctness of the control algorithms}
After the implementation of the control algorithms, the results obtained were compared with the output of the simulations.\\
In most cases, the output of the implementation and simulation are very similar, having only changed the stabilization time due to the use of the modified velocity algorithm. Even though in the implementation the car reaches the speed reference faster than in the simulations, the behavior of the car position wise is very similar, and both velocity graphics have the same wave form.\\
It was also possible to visualize that when the reference angle is not 0, in the implementation, the velocity of both wheels has a very small ripple at the same time. which did not occur in the simulations. These results are prensent in the test section \ref{sec:control-testing}.\\
In general, the implementation results were the expected, since the differences between what was obtained and what was simulated were very not significative.\\
