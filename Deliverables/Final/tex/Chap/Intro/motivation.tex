\section{Motivation and Goals}
The main goal of this project is to develop a remote controlled vehicle with the
following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Remotely operated: the vehicle must be remotely operated to enable its
    usage in critical or unaccessible areas to human operators;
  \item Provide visual feedback to the user: to be a valuable asset in the
    exploration and maintenance domains, the vehicle must provide visual
    feedback to the user of its surroundings.
  \item Safe: the vehicle must be safe to use and prevent its damage and of its
    surroundings
  \item Robust: the vehicle must be able to sustain harsh environmental
    conditions and provide redundant mechanisms to avoid control loss.
  \item Affordable: so it can be an economically viable product.
  \end{enumerate}
