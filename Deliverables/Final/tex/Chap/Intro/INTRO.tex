% CHAPTER - Introduction -------------------------
\chapter{Introduction}
The present work, within the scope of the curricular unit of Laboratórios e
Práticas Integradas II, consists in the project of the development of a product
with strong digital basis, namely, a remote controlled vehicle used to assist
exploration and maintenance in critical or unaccessible areas to human operators.

In this chapter are present the project's motivation and goals, the product
concept, the project planning and the document organisation.

%One of the ultimate goals of engineering is the ability to provide sustained 
%development, by efficiently using the available resources --- materials, energy,
%knowledge, time. This is a ``Sisyphus's stone''\footnote{King of Ephyra,
%condemned to push a stone uphill for eternity --- immortalised in ``The Myth of
%Sisyphus'' by Albert Camus}, a perpetual quest for optimisation of efforts and
%resources. One such example in the engineering field is the ability to produce
%components with the minimum amount of material needed for its function, i.e.,
%functional design of components without restrictions to geometry or type and
%number of different materials; instead the focus should be on the desired
%properties of such components, customising them for the specific field of
%application.
