\chapter{Requirements Elicitation and Specifications Definition}%
\label{ch:requirements-specs}
In this stage the project requirements are elicited, identifying the key
requirements and constraints the system being developed must meet from the
end-user perspective, captured in natural language in a product requirements
document. The end-user perspective is generally abstract, thus requiring a
methodic approach to obtain well-defined product requirements, i.e., product
specifications. The product specifications are the result of a compromise
between end-user requirements and its feasibility within the available project
resources (time, budget, and technologies available). As the specifications are
well-defined, they serve as design guidelines for the development team and can
be tested later on to assess its feasibility and, ultimately, the quality of the product.
