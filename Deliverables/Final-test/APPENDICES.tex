\chapter{Use cases (Detailed description)}%
\label{ch:append-UseCases}
In this section, the main use cases are described extensively. As many uses
cases are similar, only changing the parameter to which they refer to, the
Lighting subsystem was used as an example for the Manage<Parameter> use case,
where <Parameter> is Temperature, DoorBell, DateAndTime and SystemNotifications.

     \item If the file is successfully loaded, the filename is displayed,
       and the file previewed (include \underline{PreviewGeometryFile} use
       case).
     \item Otherwise, an error message is displayed to the user.

     Entry conditions       & The User has started the MMSLS machine control
     software and has previously generated a valid geometry file. \\ \hline 
      Exit conditions & The file is successfully loaded, previewed and with the
      filename displayed or an error message is displayed to the User.\\ \hline 
      Quality requirements &  Feedback must be given to the user within 2
      seconds; if files are ``heavy'', display an ongoing processing.\\ \hline
