\chapter{Conclusions}%
\label{ch:conclusions}
The envisioned product consists of a remote controlled car used to assist
exploration and maintenance domains, hereby, denominated as Radio Frequency
Camera Assisted Rover (RFCAR). To satisfy such requirements, the vehicle must
contain a remotely operated camera that provides a live video feed to the user.
Additionally, the vehicle must include an odometric system that assists the
driving and avoids unintentional collisions when remote control is compromised, e.g., when connection is lost.
The vehicle provides means for exploration and conditions assessment in critical
or unaccessible areas to human operators, such as fluid pipelines and other
hazardous locations.
